## Linux ate my RAM!

### Explaining that you're not low on memory As A Service.

If you're on a Linux related forum, you'll see variations of this a few times
per week:

* OMG help I have less than 1% free memory!
* I'm only running Apache but have 2GB memory used. How do I see what's using it?
* i think Linux has a memory leak, it's gradually filling RAM until i reboot

[LinuxAteMyRam.com](http://www.linuxatemyram.com) aims to be the default
response to such questions. The goal is a simple, reassuring and informative
source of information about the wonders of disk caching and what it means for
performance and monitoring tools.

Issues and pull requests welcome.
